Requires a EWT or a LUA Unlocker (code needs to be adapted).

An old LUA script which I wrote and used during Classic launch to primarily level a Hunter + Mage. 

NOT MEANT TO BE USED AS IS UNLESS YOU UNDERSTAND THE CODE AND ARE WILLING TO MAKE CHANGES TO SUITE YOUR NEEDS. 

Code can nevertheless be consulted although the code is admittedly quite messy (project was just a proof of concept to get a Hunter Alt up all the way from level 10-60 with this).

Current Configuration/Waypoints are for grinding in Felwood for Horde.

SUPPORTS (ON CONFIGURING GLOBAL VARS):
- Resurrect (configure resurrect.lua)
- Vendoring/Selling of Junk (vendors when running out of bag space)
- Buying of Arrows
- Mage and Hunter Combat Rotations ONLY
- DC on Item Break/Enemy Nearby
- Can randomize path (rndMax)
- Drawing of Routes,  Status etc…
- Mailing to Alt of valuable items (configure mail.lua) [‘toMail’]
- Auto-Junk Deletion [‘deleteItems’]
- Automatic Opening of Items ex: Clams [‘openInBags’]
- Avoids Flagged NPCs (tries to even move out of aggro range) [‘avoidNPCs’]
- Conjuring of Food/Water
- Simple Mage/Hunter Kiting
- More but I forgot…

Things amongst many that need Configuring:
- Grinding Route Waypoint (make use of Record AddOn attached to record said routes)
- Resurrect Waypoints
- Vendor Waypoints
- Names of Food/Drink/Pet Food
- Mount Name
- Items you want to ALWAYS keep
- Eat at %, Drink at %, Recover till %
- Pull distance, Mana/HP Potion Use

Really and truly, I cannot answer detailed questions about this project in much detail because it has been almost a year since I wrote this and was initially a small script which ended up into a 4000 lines of spaghetti code.
